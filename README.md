# IdeaRank - Prioritizing Ideas Through Comparison

IdeaRank is a web application that allows users to prioritize their project ideas efficiently by leveraging human comparative strength. This tool is designed to assist users in making decisions by comparing their ideas in pairs and generating a ranked list based on preferences. The application is built to be user-friendly and accessible, facilitating idea comparison and decision-making.

## Objectives

- **Efficient Prioritization**: Develop a web-based solution to help users prioritize their project ideas effectively.
- **Leverage Human Comparative Strength**: Use human judgment in pairwise comparisons to overcome decision-making weaknesses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple and intuitive interface for idea input and comparison.

## Features

- **Input Multiple Project Ideas**: Users can enter multiple project ideas to be ranked.
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Ideas are presented in pairs for comparison to simplify decision-making.
- **Preference Tracking**: Track user preferences through a partially ordered forest algorithm.
- **Generate Prioritized List**: After comparisons, the app generates a ranked list of ideas.
- **Flexible Stopping Points**: Users can stop at any point to get the top idea, top three, or full list.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Developed using the Elm programming language for a smooth, functional user experience.
- **Algorithm**: Uses a partially ordered forest algorithm to handle idea ranking based on user comparisons.
- **Deployment**: The application is web-based for easy access from any device.

## User Walkthrough

1. **Input Ideas**: Users input their project ideas into the system.
2. **Compare Ideas**: The system presents ideas in pairs for easy comparison.
3. **Make a Choice**: Users choose their preferred idea in each pair.
4. **Algorithm Process**: The system's algorithm processes the inputs and generates a prioritized list of ideas.
5. **Get Results**: Users can retrieve their top idea, top 3 ideas, or a complete ranked list, and can stop at any point during the process.

## Applications and Use Cases

### Practical Uses:
- Personal project prioritization
- Team brainstorming sessions
- Product feature selection
- Research topic selection

### Constraints:
- Relies on the user’s ability to make comparative judgments effectively.
- The effectiveness of the output is dependent on the quality of the initial ideas entered.
- May require multiple sessions if working with a large number of ideas.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Application**: Open the web-based application from any browser.
2. **Input your Ideas**: Enter all the project ideas you need to prioritize.
3. **Start Comparing**: The application will begin presenting pairs of ideas for comparison.
4. **View Your Results**: Once you’ve compared enough pairs, the system will generate a prioritized list of your ideas.
